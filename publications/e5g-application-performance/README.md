## Abstract

The fifth generation (5G) cellular mobile network promises a com- bination of high speed and ultra-low latency to enable use cases not possible before. To accomplish this 5G makes use of new radio technologies like mmWave, which works at much higher frequen- cies than previous cellular network standards. The problems of using high frequency bands include poor radio propagation and sensitivity to blockages. This report investigates how commonly used network applications will be affected when transitioning from todayâ€™s cellular networks to 5G. The performance of file downloads, video streaming, and web surfing are evaluated in an emulated 5G network and are compared to 4G experiments. The main out- comes of the experiments are that: mmWave generally outperforms 4G/LTE; applications can suffer, both in terms of throughput and la- tency, from the large capacity variations in mmWave channels; TCP loss recovery and congestion control needs to consider mmWave channel dynamics better to enable large application gains when moving from 4G to 5G.
